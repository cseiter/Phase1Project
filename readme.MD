Project Requirements
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Your project's DOM Manipulation should be well structured, following the pattern of creating reusable components and appending them to the DOM.

MVP:

single topic search results with a button to show results.  CSS adds borders to table elements.

Stretch 1:
dropdown to include the rest of the search topics and display results.

Stretch 2:
change from dropdown list to icon bar, like the dogshow library.

Stretch 3:
"loading" gif while fetch is happening.

Stretch 4:
randomize loading gif.

Stretch 5:
table background image to go along with icon bar, but faded.

Stretch 6:
combine each of the separate functions into one and dynamically create tables based on size of search results table.

Stretch 7:
replace unique key search results with appropriate names of games, places...

Stretch 8:
try to get count totals to start doing data mining and charts.
